### **Treasury Single Account**

A Treasury Single Account (TSA) is a unified structure of government bank accounts that gives a consolidated view of government cash resources. Based on the principle of unity of cash and the unity of treasury, a TSA is a bank account or a set of linked accounts through which the government transacts all its receipts and payments. The principle of unity follows from the fungibility of all cash irrespective of its end use. While it is necessary to distinguish individual cash transactions for control and reporting purposes, this purpose is achieved through the accounting system and not by holding/depositing cash in transaction-specific bank accounts. [This enables the treasury to delink management of cash from control at a transaction level](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10143.pdf#%3A~%3Atext%3DA%20treasury%20single%20account%20%28TSA%29%20is%20an%20essential%2Cpriority%20in%20the%20public%20financial%20management%20reform%20agenda).
